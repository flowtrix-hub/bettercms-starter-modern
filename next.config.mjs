// Static export: BetterCMS hosting serves the build as static files, and the deploy Action fetches
// content into bcms-content.json BEFORE `next build` (no API key at build time). Every page resolves
// from that snapshot → a fully static `out/`.

  // The contact/search/newsletter client components import @bettercms-ai/sdk, which pulls in the SDK's
  // Node-only management client (dns/fs). Those paths never run in the browser, so stub the Node
  // builtins out of the client bundle.
  // BOTH bundlers are configured on purpose. Next 16 turned Turbopack on by default and HARD
  // ERRORS on a `webpack` config with no `turbopack` config, so the two must be kept in step:
  // `turbopack` is what `next build` uses now, `webpack` is what `next build --webpack` still
  // uses. Turbopack has no `resolve.fallback: { x: false }`, so "resolve to nothing" is spelled
  // as an alias to an empty module, scoped to the `browser` condition so the server build keeps
  // the real modules. In practice only the `*/promises` specifiers fail to resolve without this;
  // the rest are listed to mirror the webpack set exactly, so the two cannot silently diverge.
